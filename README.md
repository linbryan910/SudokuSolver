# SudokuSolver

This program solves a sudoku puzzle using:
 - the cross hatching method

As the cross hatching method is elementary, this program will not be able to solve more difficult programs. 

This program was written in C# using the .NET framework. 

More features will be added to this program in the future (which will allow it to solve more difficult puzzles).
