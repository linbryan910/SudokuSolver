# SudokuSolver

This program solves a sudoku puzzle using:
 - the cross hatching method
 - the naked pairs method

As the cross hatching method is elementary, this program will not be able to solve more difficult programs. 

This program was written in C# using the .NET framework. 

More features will be added to this program in the future (which will allow it to solve more difficult puzzles).

To-Do:
 - Add feature to read in input from formatted text file (Or easily input puzzle and can easily check that puzzle is entered correctly)
 - Explain what cross hatching and naked pair techniques are on readme.md
 - Make printing out the puzzle also really easy to read
